# Flyway Autoddl

This is a simple POC to have DDL scripts automatically generated by Hibernate calculating the delta between the current state of the DB schema and the status of
Java objects annotated with `@Entity`.

## Structure

This is just the `main` branch and it does not contain any working code. The working POCs are in the two branches and they differ in type:

1. `hibernate-only`: provides a POC that works with entities that do not need auditing
2. `hibernate-and-envers`: provides a POC that works with entities that do need auditing and thus require `envers` as a dependency

Please DO NOT run any code in this branch as it won't work.
